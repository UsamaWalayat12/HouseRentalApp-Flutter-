## Rive Animation Files

To add Rive animations to your app:

1. **Download a Rive file**: You can find free Rive animations at:
   - [Rive Community](https://rive.app/community/)
   - [Rive Marketplace](https://rive.app/marketplace/)

2. **Place the .riv file here**: Save your Rive file as `liquid_download.riv` in this folder.

3. **Popular free animations you can use**:
   - Loading animations
   - Success/error animations
   - Button interactions
   - Form animations

## Example Rive Files

For the register page, you might want to use:
- A loading animation
- A success animation for form submission
- An interactive button animation

## How to Create Your Own Rive Animation

1. Go to [rive.app](https://rive.app)
2. Create a new project
3. Design your animation
4. Export as .riv file
5. Place it in this assets folder

## Current Status

The app is looking for `liquid_download.riv` but it's not found. 
You can either:
1. Add a Rive file with this name
2. Change the filename in the code to match your file
3. The app will work without the animation (graceful fallback)
